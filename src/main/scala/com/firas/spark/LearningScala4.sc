  // Data structures

  // Tuples (Also really common with Spark!!)
  // Immutable lists
  // Often thought of as database fields, or columns.
  // Useful for passing around entire rows of data.

  val captainStuff = ("Picard", "Enterprise-D", "NCC-1701-D")
  //> captainStuff  : (String, String, String) = (Picard,Enterprise-D,NCC-1701-D)
  //|
  println(captainStuff)                           //> (Picard,Enterprise-D,NCC-1701-D)

  // You refer to individual fields with their ONE-BASED index:
  println(captainStuff._1)                        //> Picard
  println(captainStuff._2)                        //> Enterprise-D
  println(captainStuff._3)                        //> NCC-1701-D

  // You can create a key/value pair with ->
  val picardsShip = "Picard" -> "Enterprise-D"     //> picardsShip  : (String, String) = (Picard,Enterprise-D)
  println(picardsShip._1)                          //> Enterprise-D

  // You can mix different types in a tuple
  val aBunchOfStuff = ("Kirk", 1964, true)         //> aBunchOfStuff  : (String, Int, Boolean) = (Kirk,1964,true)



  // Lists
  // Like a tuple, but it's an actual Collection object that has more functionality.
  // It's a singly-linked list under the hood.

  val shipList = List("Enterprise", "Defiant", "Voyager", "Deep Space Nine")
  //> shipList  : List[String] = List(Enterprise, Defiant, Voyager, Deep Space Nin
  //| e)

  // Access individual members using () with ZERO-BASED index (confused yet?)
  println(shipList(1))                             //> Defiant

  // head and tail give you the first item, and the remaining ones.
  println(shipList.head)                           //> Enterprise
  println(shipList.tail)                           //> List(Defiant, Voyager, Deep Space Nine)


  // Iterating though a list
  for (ship <- shipList) {println(ship)}           //> Enterprise
  //| Defiant
  //| Voyager
  //| Deep Space Nine

  // Let's apply a function literal to a list! map() can be used to apply any function to every item in a collection.
  val backwardShips = shipList.map( (ship: String) => {ship.reverse})
  //> backwardShips  : List[String] = List(esirpretnE, tnaifeD, regayoV, eniN eca
  //| pS peeD)
  for (ship <- backwardShips) {println(ship)}      //> esirpretnE
  //| tnaifeD
  //| regayoV
  //| eniN ecapS peeD

  // reduce() can be used to combine together all the items in a collection using some function.
  val numberList = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)              //> numberList  : List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  val sum = numberList.reduce( (x: Int, y: Int) => x + y)
  //> sum  : Int = 15
  println(sum)                                      //> 15

  // filter() can remove stuff you don't want. Here we'll introduce wildcard syntax while we're at it.
  val iHateFives = numberList.filter( (x: Int) => x != 5)
  //> iHateFives  : List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)
  val iHateThrees = numberList.filter(_ != 3)       //> iHateThrees  : List[Int] = List(1, 2, 4, 5)

  // Note that Spark has its own map, reduce, and filter functions that can distribute these operations. But they work the same way!
  // Also, you understand MapReduce now :)

  // Concatenating lists
  val moreNumbers = List(1, 7, 8)                   //> moreNumbers  : List[Int] = List(6, 7, 8)
  val lotsOfNumbers = numberList ++ moreNumbers     //> lotsOfNumbers  : List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)

  // More list fun
  val reversed = shipList.reverse                 //> reversed  : List[Int] = List(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
  val sorted = reversed.sorted                      //> sorted  : List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  val lotsOfDuplicates = numberList ++ numberList   //> lotsOfDuplicates  : List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  val distinctValues = lotsOfDuplicates.distinct    //> distinctValues  : List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  val maxValue = numberList.max                     //> maxValue  : Int = 5
  val total = numberList.sum                        //> total  : Int = 15
  val hasThree = iHateThrees.contains(3)            //> hasThree  : Boolean = false

  // Maps
  // Useful for key/value lookups on distinct keys
  // Like dictionaries in other languages

  val shipMap = Map("Kirk" -> "Enterprise", "Picard" -> "Enterprise-D", "Sisko" -> "Deep Space Nine", "Janeway" -> "Voyager")
  //> shipMap  : scala.collection.immutable.Map[String,String] = Map(Kirk -> Ente
  //| rprise, Picard -> Enterprise-D, Sisko -> Deep Space Nine, Janeway -> Voyage
  //| r)
  println(shipMap("Janeway"))                       //> Voyager

  // Dealing with missing keys
  println(shipMap.contains("Kirk"))               //> false

  val archersShip = util.Try(shipMap("Archer")) getOrElse "Unknown"
  //> archersShip  : String = Unknown
  println(archersShip)                              //> Unknown

  // EXERCISE
  // Create a list of the numbers 1-20; your job is to print out numbers that are evenly divisible by three. (Scala's
  // modula operator, like other languages, is %, which gives you the remainder after division. For example, 9 % 3 = 0
  // because 9 is evenly divisible by 3.) Do this first by iterating through all the items in the list and testing each
  // one as you go. Then, do it again by using a filter function on the list instead.

  // That's enough for now!
  // There is MUCH more to learn about Scala. We didn't cover many other collection types, including mutable collections.
  // And we didn't even touch on object-oriented Scala. The book "Learning Scala" from O'Reilly is great if you want to
  // go into more depth - but you've got enough to get through this course for now.
